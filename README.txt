Anonymise non structured data before sending to LLM

09/07/2024

Added try.py, not working properly, an itteration on anon.py, to properly recognize names.

Ideas on how to improve:

- train LLM on namin lists that can be found online, first and last names.
- use Claude 3.5 Sonnet / GPT-4o to use dutch and english grammar reasoning to improve the Python script to recognize where names are mentioned.
- user robberta or BERT models in Python.

Adjusted to data in the Netherlands.
1st draft, many adjustments needed.
